# osu-api
.NET DLL library to use the osu! public api in .NET programs

## Current status
I'm working on it, as I (or friends) need to use the API.

### Current features
* /get_users
* /get_beatmaps
* /get_scores
* /get_user_best
* /get_user_recent
* /get_match

## Note
The solution is supposed to contain a Console app project. That's because I used a project of this kind to test the wrapper, so don't mind the error.
