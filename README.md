# osu-api
.NET DLL library to use the osu! public api in .NET programs

## Current status
Version 1.0 done! Will release asap.
UPDATE: it's broken af, fixing shit

### Current features
* /get_user
* /get_beatmaps
* /get_scores
* /get_user_best
* /get_user_recent
* /get_match

## Note
The solution is supposed to contain a Console app project. That's because I used a project of this kind to test the wrapper, so don't mind the error.
